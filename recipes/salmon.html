    <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            This grilled salmon tastes so good! A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, 
            with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. 
            Even my 9-year-old loves this recipe! Serve with a side of grilled 
            zucchini or grilled corn.
