First HTML Project (Recipes)

I would've learned the basic commands of HTML, like using various tags, inserting links from external and internal sources, and inserting images as well. 

I have successfully implemented HTML using:
Tags: p, em, strong, img, a, h1, h2, ul, ol, li, body, head, html, meta, title
Attributes: href, src, rel, target, alt, height, width, charset
Actions: 
Open new page on a new tab 
Open new page on same tab 
Open external links 
Included images
